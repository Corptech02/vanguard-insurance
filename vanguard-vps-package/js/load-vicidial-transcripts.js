        '43635': `Hello? Hello? Hey. How are you doing today? Alright. That's good to hear. I'm doing alright myself. My name is Grant giving you a call from UIG, and I'm calling you here because I noticed your trucking insurance is close to expiration. I believe you'd be eligible for a better price. I also noticed you're out of Ohio. We're out of Brunswick, Ohio ourselves. And, if you don't mind me asking, I was curious how much you were paying. Well, we do livestock, and so many people don't like livestock people. Gotcha. Fortunately, we we do have practically every market available in Ohio, so so we do handle livestock. Do you typically do you have two trucks, one truck? Usually just one. The guy runs over the road. Yeah. Those are local. Gotcha. One truck, one trailer. And you guys are under a 100 miles locally? Oh, no. I run by 600 mile radius. Five, six hundred. How come so so large being local? Well, normally with livestock, that's about the closest plants anymore. Oh, man. Now would you say 80% of the time you're going over 500? No. I would say 50. 50% of the time? 40 yeah. 45, 50. Excuse me. Three, four hundred. Okay. So 80% of the time, you're going about three, four hundred, but then that other 20, you're going past 500. Gotcha. Well, that's that's gonna help a lot. And then, what what type of trailer is that you're holding the livestock? Semi trailer. Semi trailer? Wilson. Yeah. Gotcha. And what what's the brand on that? Wilson. Wilson. And then the year on that as well? '14. '14. Gotcha. Yeah. I'm I'm pretty confident we can get you a strong price here, especially being that I I believe you're with Progressive right now, and their their rates are a little steep right now in the market. What what was the year and brand for that truck? It's an eighteen five seventy nine p. Gotcha. That's it. I love the Peterbilt. How's that holding out for you? So far. Knock on wood. I don't want to hear anything, though. That's good to hear. I can't gotta be safe. Yeah. And I know I heard that progressive, but, I mean, they've been good on deer strikes and that out. You know, a lot of people wanted to drop you even though you hit a buck or something, but that's the only thing. I've just always been with them. So I've never really shopped around, I guess. Because I he's a local guy, and, I mean, he usually searches around, but I'm not I guess you should switch every three years regardless of who you know they say. But I just heard some a horror stories with my buddies. You know, you get something major going on and they cancel you overnight, then you're in trouble. Yeah. And and that's you definitely don't wanna deal with anything under a a rated. Because when you get into the c's and the b's is when they they start dropping, you know, off of, weird things like that. But I get it. And, you should move it around a little bit because the reason I'm calling you is Progressive's at a peak in price right now. So, you you're eligible. Your DOT is eligible for some other markets that are a little more premium. And they're they're not gonna drop you like a like that if something's bad. It's typically we only run, I don't know, seventy, eighty, 100,000 miles at the most. Yeah. But okay. I'll I might give you a buzz back then. Yeah. And we'll tell you what four or five buddies, and they've all been looking around too because they're fed up with the pricing. Because the revenue is not here. The trucking right now is probably as bad as it was in the eighties as far as the revenue. It is rough. It really is. And you got a lot of foreigners coming in working for pennies on the 60%. 60% is hauling foreigners are hauling the freight, and they're putting three or four to a truck. Oh, yeah. It's it's rough out there, and the insurance is increasing. Good thing the gas came down a bit, but it's still higher than it should be. Oh, yeah. It's I mean, crude's a trash of every petroleum, and it's still that's kinda why I went with that. It's five seventy nine p. It's just a little bit better on mileage. It is. I've I've definitely heard good things mileage wise about them. And how long have you had your CDL for? Since 8182. That's incredible. So you got got some good experience in the industry. You've seen it all, Yeah. Price four, five, 6,000,000 miles. Wow. You got a pretty good start if I can get another 20. Well, I gotta tell you why. Since around nineteen seventy nine, seventy eight. Wow. And how come you're sticking with livestock? Just something you're We farm too, typically, and it's kinda like that's all we've ever done. So you started out farming and then you got into the Yeah. Grandpa has trucks. My dad too, clear in the sixties. We had some of the first livestock truck. Oh, wow. And how Yeah. We've been trucking few years since around sixties, nineteen fifty seven, eight. Wow. And and what got you what got you into that? Just your your old man getting into it himself? Yep. Grandpa. Yeah. It's kinda the old joke. A guy trained me at fifty five, sixty years of trucking. He said, I'm gonna tell you right now. He said, I've been trucking this long. He said, I got about half of what I started with. I'm like, well, that's really a good plan. I need to stay on board. Wait. You got any kids as yourself? Yeah. I got it. You getting them into the business? Yeah. But they got families. I don't really like being gone zero or three days. Oh, yeah. It's it's rough. You gotta be willing to be on your own for quite a bit there. But now I can give you a buzz back or something. Yeah. And tell you what, I'll make it easy for you too. I could shoot you a text message or or give you a call when I get a a number back just so you get an idea of what it costs and, what would you like? My email if you wanna send it to me. I think I got that here. Is that m u m ford farms? Yep. Alright. Perfect. @aol.com. Right? Yep. Alright. Yeah. I'll, I'll shoot something over price wise just, out of value of your time, and we can see if you wanna proceed or not. Alright. I appreciate it. I appreciate your time. Yep. No problem. And this is Charles. Right? Yep. This is Charles. You you go by Charles is what you prefer to go by? Yeah. Alright. Appreciate you, Charles. I'm Grant once again. Okay. Take care. Yep.`,
