    "transcript": "Hello? Who's calling? This is Grant calling from UIG. How are you doing today? Alright. It's good to hear. I'm doing alright myself. Well, calling here at a UIG based out of Brunswick, Ohio because I noticed your trucking insurance is close to expiration. I believe you'd be eligible for a more premium coverage option at a more affordable price. That being said, if you don't mind me asking, how much are you currently paying? 17,000. 17,000. Is that two trucks or, three trucks? One. Oh, one truck. Gotcha. That seems pretty steep, man, right off the bat. Is that a box truck or a truck and trailer? Just a truck. Just a what are you hauling? Auto? Refrigerated reefer. Reefer. Okay. That makes a bit more sense there. You use trailer interchange for reefer? Mhmm. Gotcha, man. And what do you got that set up? About 50? Something around there, I'm guessing? Trailer change. Yep. Gotcha. Yeah, man. It does seem pretty steep. Do you do you got some some violations and stuff going on or anything recently? Nope. Oh, man. Jeez. How how long have you did your CDL for? Ten years now. Over ten years. Ten years? CDL. Charging you 1,700 in one truck. Wow. Let me guess. It's progressive, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. I figured. Have you, shopped around at all in any other companies? Not not really. Yeah. Well, progressive right now is pretty steep. The the rates are kinda peaked, especially in the reefer and auto area. That's why I was kinda assuming you're in that end area. What what is the year on that truck? February. February? February. And then what's the brand? Freightliner. Freightliner. Okay. Can't go wrong with a Freightliner. Gotcha. And then how how far do you usually drive out? Are you over 500 miles? Or not all the time. But You do go past the sum what about 80% of the time when are you usually going? 80% of the time within 500. Within 500. Okay. So 500 peak. I mean, would you say 80% of the time, 400, 300, or right on 500? Right now, 80% of the time is 300. Three. Perfect. Change that probably. You you plan on going past that or coming down a little bit? Going past it probably. Gotcha. Okay. The Georgia area. Georgia? How's the loads up in Georgia? Is that pretty good for reefer? Yeah. Dude, I heard the guys in California coming out of California, they are making crazy money, especially with berries. But it it's berries and again. Oh, yeah. True. Those are you ever what what do you typically haul, in reefer? Groceries. Groceries. Groceries. That's what I have. Frozen. That's nice. You ever you ever touch any berries or anything? Sometimes. But it don't be a truck full. It just be whatever they have on the trailer. There you go. Well, if you got if you got time now I mean, I I just need, like, three minutes, and I can I can tell you right right now? I'm just putting in your information. Just say add a value of your time to get an idea of what it is. K. Go ahead. What's your, date of birth? 04/2792. What insurance company is this? I'm with United Insurance Group. We're out of Brunswick, Ohio. One of the reasons I I reached out with you. I noticed you're local. Right. You say United Insurance Group? What's that, a United Insurance Group. Agency? Yeah. That's the insurance agency. We work with practically every market in Ohio. We have Great West, Progressive, Erie, Canal, GEICO. I mean I mean, practically everything. Thai. Oh, the Great West Insurance? We do have Great West. Oh, Erie Canal. That's a Canal is the take out a mile one. Mhmm. Oh, okay. But right now, I mean, Progressive is stacked up to be one of the lowest on the like, as for oh, I guess you could say it's more one of the highest ones right now. You're a younger guy. Are you married or single? 33 single. Oh, man. You gotta stay that way. I wouldn't I wouldn't try to get into anything. No. So what got you in the truck?

I'm here. Hold on. I'm here. Hello? Yep. What's the model on that Trail Liner? That's, Century. It's a 2000 Century. Oh, Century. Gotcha. And then I'm assuming you got physical coverage on that? No. I don't. No. Oh, man. And there no physical and they're they got you up to 1,700. Are you serious? No. I'm at 1,900 for a month from Progressive right now. Oh my god. Yeah. We gotta we gotta do something about this. And what's your ZIP code? 441O05. O5. K. And then you're from Garfield Heights? Yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha, man. So what what got you into the trucking business? I always I mean, I don't know. I don't even have a no reason why I got in. Just husband driving trucks. There you go, man. And, you've been at it for quite some time, so you got a fair share understanding of how it's rolling. Mhmm. Good to hear, man. You doing anything before this? Working at the post office. How was that for you? Less money. Alright. Where where do you usually park this vehicle when it's not in use? At this truck parking on Lee on Lee Road. Lee Road? Yeah. Cleveland. Is that L E E Road? Yep. Yeah. I got it here. Alright. Let's see. Offer ten years. Almost done here. Just put it on the basics. Man, it's crazy to think 2015 was ten years ago. Oh my gosh. That is crazy. And then you've been operating, what, three to six years or seven years plus for your business? For my business, three to six. Three to six. Gotcha. You've been, with Progressive this whole time? Or Yep. Gotcha. And then a million liability, a million aggregate, or 2,000,000 aggregate? 2,000,000 aggregate, a 100,000 cargo, 50,000 trailer interchange. That sounds about right. Put you at, how about your deductibles? What do you typically put on for your deductibles? I'll tell you, you said, a 2,500. 25. Okay. Do you have a briefer breakdown coverage? Yep. Gotcha. Groceries. And then you hold seafood as well? I don't turn. I haven't hold in in a while. Gotcha. We'll just say Right. Do you do, like, meats and, like, poultry and stuff or primarily just frozen food? No. Meats, poultry, all of that. Alright. Do you handle any kind of dairy or eggs? Dairy. Yeah. Dairy. Okay. 100,000 for the cargo. Lastly, we'll just put the trailer exchange in here, and then we'll have our amount. You just use one non owned trailer though? Yeah. Do I use one or different one? How many do you, like, typically cycle between? You do you have, like, an established agreement with, for a single trailer, or do you typically just, go around and have multiple? Multiple. Okay. That's no problem. And that's just a reefer driving for 50 k, you said? For a trailer and change? Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Okay. So, pretty pretty good news here. I got one for you at fifteen hundred a month. You said you were at 17 or 19 with Progressive? 19. 19. So we got something at 15 a month. And this is you're gonna have 5,000 medical. You got a million uninsured motorist, bodily injury, a million combined total. You have two million aggregate, 100,000 cargo. You got that 50,000 trailer interchange, 100,000 cargo with 2,500 deductibles. So pretty much everything matched here, reefer breakdown included. This came back as the most competitive out of our, our prorator. Okay. And what company is that through? So we it doesn't necessarily tell us the exact one until we proceed here, but, this one's either gonna be Canal, Great West, or GEICO. They came the most competitive with your current situation. Those three. So those rates may vary up until the day, slightly, not a ton. And so we we lock it down, lock it in, and then you're good for the year. But those ones are very close, so it's gonna it's gonna cycle between those three for the most competitive. They're all a rated companies. We don't deal with anything under a, so you you don't have to worry about any problems with payouts or anything or if you have any claims. I know that's a really big concern. I can, I can prepare a proposal a quote proposal for you here if you wanted to look at it over email and make sure everything was cup of tea for you and see how you wanna proceed if you're interested? No. Yeah. You can do that. I've I got a I got a quote from Great West already for, like, 1,500 already. Oh, yeah. They're pretty they're pretty solid. The only issue with Great West is they typically, and and you could talk to your buddies if if anyone's already with Great West. They typically raise the next year pretty aggressively. So and that's fine if you're prepared to to switch when the time comes. But we have Great West as well, and I I have no problem offering them. But, ideally, Daikin and Canal is probably gonna be a better bet if you wanted to stick with them for about three years, which would be better because they end up actually decreasing their rates if you're with them longer. But Great West is one of those, companies that typically likes to spike right off the second year. Because right now, they're buying business like crazy. If I can send you out a couple ones, I have a Great West as well. I can send you a proposal back. Being that you already have one, I can send you one of, GEICO, one of Canal, so you can gauge that. Okay. That's fine. Whatever whatever you're looking to do, man. Uh-huh. You can send it to me and, I can go over it. I'm starting to think that, these rates go off by by the ZIP code where this truck is parked at. Because I had a guy before use a different address for me, and it was way less. Yeah. And and you know what? They recently got picky about that too, funny enough. That's I I typically don't ask people for the address until, the system started, prompting me for it, which was bizarre. So I you you're probably right. You you probably got a I tried to I didn't have a truck at first, and I was and I was just going I wanna activate my authority to get it going. He said, well, he can he can put it on there. I got some kind of pickup truck or something, an older truck, and he used a ZIP a house I mean, a ZIP code in Southern Ohio, and it was, like, $600 a month. I'm like, what the hell? Yeah. I believe it. That it was that's a $600 a month, my bad. It was really cheap. But I'm starting to see now They go by where you live at. Yeah. They're they're getting weird they're getting weird about it now. They they need more information than they ever did. That's for sure. Yeah. He, sent me the thing in my email. Yeah. Of course. And then, what's that email? Is that, d roberts at hogging, d lanes dot com? Yeah. Alright. Hogging lanes dot com? Yep. Alright. Perfect. Yeah. I'll, I'll put this up. I'll put our most competitive rates in there. And, if you're interested, man, we can proceed from there. Okay. Alright. Do you have any any questions for me or anything? No. Nothing right now. Alright. Sweet man. I appreciate your time very much. Once again, my name is Grant. It was, it was great talking to you. Alright. Appreciate it, sir. Thank you. Take care.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hello? Hey. How are you doing today? Alright. That's good to hear. I'm doing alright myself. My name is Grant giving you a call from UIG, and I'm calling you here because I noticed your trucking insurance is close to expiration. I believe you'd be eligible for a better price. I also noticed you're out of Ohio. We're out of Brunswick, Ohio ourselves. And, if you don't mind me asking, I was curious how much you were paying. Well, we do livestock, and so many people don't like livestock people. Gotcha. Fortunately, we we do have practically every market available in Ohio, so so we do handle livestock. Do you typically do you have two trucks, one truck? Usually just one. The guy runs over the road. Yeah. Those are local. Gotcha. One truck, one trailer. And you guys are under a 100 miles locally? Oh, no. I run by 600 mile radius. Five, six hundred. How come so so large being local? Well, normally with livestock, that's about the closest plants anymore. Oh, man. Now would you say 80% of the time you're going over 500? No. I would say 50. 50% of the time? 40 yeah. 45, 50. Excuse me. Three, four hundred. Okay. So 80% of the time, you're going about three, four hundred, but then that other 20, you're going past 500. Gotcha. Well, that's that's gonna help a lot. And then, what what type of trailer is that you're holding the livestock? Semi trailer. Semi trailer? Wilson. Yeah. Gotcha. And what what's the brand on that? Wilson. Wilson. And then the year on that as well? '14. '14. Gotcha. Yeah. I'm I'm pretty confident we can get you a strong price here, especially being that I I believe you're with Progressive right now, and their their rates are a little steep right now in the market. What what was the year and brand for that truck? It's an eighteen five seventy nine p. Gotcha. That's it. I love the Peterbilt. How's that holding out for you? So far. Knock on wood. I don't want to hear anything, though. That's good to hear. I can't gotta be safe. Yeah. And I know I heard that progressive, but, I mean, they've been good on deer strikes and that out. You know, a lot of people wanted to drop you even though you hit a buck or something, but that's the only thing. I've just always been with them. So I've never really shopped around, I guess. Because I he's a local guy, and, I mean, he usually searches around, but I'm not I guess you should switch every three years regardless of who you know they say. But I just heard some a horror stories with my buddies. You know, you get something major going on and they cancel you overnight, then you're in trouble. Yeah. And and that's you definitely don't wanna deal with anything under a a rated. Because when you get into the c's and the b's is when they they start dropping, you know, off of, weird things like that. But I get it. And, you should move it around a little bit because the reason I'm calling you is Progressive's at a peak in price right now. So, you you're eligible. Your DOT is eligible for some other markets that are a little more premium. And they're they're not gonna drop you like a like that if something's bad. It's typically we only run, I don't know, seventy, eighty, 100,000 miles at the most. Yeah. But okay. I'll I might give you a buzz back then. Yeah. And we'll tell you what four or five buddies, and they've all been looking around too because they're fed up with the pricing. Because the revenue is not here. The trucking right now is probably as bad as it was in the eighties as far as the revenue. It is rough. It really is. And you got a lot of foreigners coming in working for pennies on the 60%. 60% is hauling foreigners are hauling the freight, and they're putting three or four to a truck. Oh, yeah. It's it's rough out there, and the insurance is increasing. Good thing the gas came down a bit, but it's still higher than it should be. Oh, yeah. It's I mean, crude's a trash of every petroleum, and it's still that's kinda why I went with that. It's five seventy nine p. It's just a little bit better on mileage. It is. I've I've definitely heard good things mileage wise about them. And how long have you had your CDL for? Since 8182. That's incredible. So you got got some good experience in the industry. You've seen it all, Yeah. Price four, five, 6,000,000 miles. Wow. You got a pretty good start if I can get another 20. Well, I gotta tell you why. Since around nineteen seventy nine, seventy eight. Wow. And how come you're sticking with livestock? Just something you're We farm too, typically, and it's kinda like that's all we've ever done. So you started out farming and then you got into the Yeah. Grandpa has trucks. My dad too, clear in the sixties. We had some of the first livestock truck. Oh, wow. And how Yeah. We've been trucking few years since around sixties, nineteen fifty seven, eight. Wow. And and what got you what got you into that? Just your your old man getting into it himself? Yep. Grandpa. Yeah. It's kinda the old joke. A guy trained me at fifty five, sixty years of trucking. He said, I'm gonna tell you right now. He said, I've been trucking this long. He said, I got about half of what I started with. I'm like, well, that's really a good plan. I need to stay on board. Wait. You got any kids as yourself? Yeah. I got it. You getting them into the business? Yeah. But they got families. I don't really like being gone zero or three days. Oh, yeah. It's it's rough. You gotta be willing to be on your own for quite a bit there. But now I can give you a buzz back or something. Yeah. And tell you what, I'll make it easy for you too. I could shoot you a text message or or give you a call when I get a a number back just so you get an idea of what it costs and, what would you like? My email if you wanna send it to me. I think I got that here. Is that m u m ford farms? Yep. Alright. Perfect. @aol.com. Right? Yep. Alright. Yeah. I'll, I'll shoot something over price wise just, out of value of your time, and we can see if you wanna proceed or not. Alright. I appreciate it. I appreciate your time. Yep. No problem. And this is Charles. Right? Yep. This is Charles. You you go by Charles is what you prefer to go by? Yeah. Alright. Appreciate you, Charles. I'm Grant once again. Okay. Take care. Yep.",

That being said, if you don't mind me asking, how much are you currently paying? Man, shoot. That's a good question. I bet we're paying about, man, I think I think it's about 10,000 a year and a year. Gotcha. About 10,000 a year there. And then how many trucks and trailers is that? Is that, two trucks, two trailers, or more? Now we're running four trucks. Four trucks, 10,000 a unit. I think it's somewhere in that $910,000. I'm right off right now. Four trucks, four trailers as well? Well, I got a little bit more truck a little bit more trailers, but four trucks. Yes. Gotcha. How how many trailers do you got there? Oh, man. I tell you what. Send me a email. You got my email? I do here. Is that dispatch at, ken transport dot com? Yes, sir. What's your what's your numbers looking like? Let me ask you that. Well, I do need to get a little bit more information to get an idea of where we would be at, but, they got you in about 10,000 per truck is what you said annually. Well, let me guess. 10,000 is pretty steep. How far do you drive on mile radius? That would help a lot. But it's about a mile radius. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's we can really be competitive with that then. I'm definitely thinking we could we could get you a lot closer to about six or seven k per truck. Oh, yeah. You guys you guys have any problems or accidents recently? No. Well, I tell you what. I tell you what. Because I'm about to lose you here. I'm not I've been a bottom. Mhmm. I've seen you everything, lot of runs, all that stuff. Just send me send me a email, and I'll send you out a vehicle, the drivers, and, anything else you need in that email. Alright.
